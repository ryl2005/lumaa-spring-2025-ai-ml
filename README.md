# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation

---

## Overview

This project makes a content recommendation system that suggests movies to a user based on a short description of the desired movie. The framework uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to check a user's input with the database and return the most similar results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this recommendation system is a list of 250 top movies from IMDB in 2022. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
